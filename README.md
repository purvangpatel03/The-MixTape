# The MixTape

The Mixtape' - a fun Flutter app that brings music from all over the world right to your fingertips! With The Mixtape, you can easily discover tons of songs by different artists, all thanks to handy JSON APIs.

But what makes it super cool? Well, it's got this awesome mini-player that keeps your tunes playing smoothly while you browse around the app. 

Simple, sleek, and totally user-friendly, The Mixtape shows off my passion for creating cool stuff that makes listening to music online a blast!
